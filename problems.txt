# (P) -> Problem    (U) -> Uncertainity/may be a problem or not

- (P) Powerlaw does not fit the data well in the script's current version, it tries to fit the lower energies only.

- (P) Parameter initialization: When I set the gaussian_norm to -1,1e-2,-1e12,-1e12,-1e-12,-1e-12 and did not set any limits to
TBabs_nH, the fit failed giving the error "zero model norms". Setting the first value of gaussian_norm from -1 to -1e-3 resolved the
issue regardless of whether TBabs_nH has lower/upper limits or not, however this could be a sign the revise the parameter initialization
for running the script for the first time

- (U) Cflux error calculation: I am not sure whether calling Fit.error() for calculating the error boundaries while using cflux is the correct way 
to do it or not. I also called the error command such that "Fit.error(maximum 50 {parameterNumber})" because sometimes the error command did not work saying that the
reduced chi squared is bigger than 2. This part probably needs a revision

- (U) Finding the global minimum: When I change the initialization values for parameters (or when I switch between restartModels = True/False
while running the script multiple times for same observations), although slightly, the fit results change from time to time, which
means that the script has some problems finding the true global minimum. Maybe revise the fitting method in future
